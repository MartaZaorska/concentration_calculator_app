## General info

PWA application that which gives the user to calculate the volume, mass and concentration unit conversions. The user can calculate what amount of substance and solvent should be combined to obtain a solution with a specific concentration (percentage or molar). The last functionality is the ability to calculate what amount of substance (e.g. medicine) and solvent should be combined to get the dose specified for the tested object (the user enters the weight of the object, the number of tested objects and the dose).
